# Future features

## Next window — locked long build (Aug 20) — landed

Sticky place stayed dead. Upgrade is two clicks. Desert is a place (sand tiles, props, portals). Four Desert bodies are painted and wired, each with one verb. Prepare/battle pad is still a quiet loop (battle a bit louder). Arrow + Cannon fork after Lv3.

### Parked
7th tower, endless, splash/economy retune, 14-arrow Forest 10 start gold, Ice/lightning/fire/poison forks, unique art for Ice/Fire/Hollow.

### Watch-outs
- Fixed-path TD; towers never on path. BCI: large buttons, no drag, no hover-only.
- Forest save may be 8/10 — do not wipe localStorage.
- Ice/Fire/Hollow still Forest-path flipped + palette (no unique tiles yet).
- Quality gates: `npm test`, `npm run build`, smoke title → Forest 1 → place → start wave → damage.

## Before new ideas

Campaign shape is in (50 maps, roster names, shared `combat.ts`). Do not open a 7th tower or endless yet.

1. **Play** Forest 1 → Forest 2 → Look at Desert waves 3 and 7. Did the land change the decision, or only the wallpaper?
2. **Then retune** splash / economy / HP. Roster + Desert verbs have landed; tune after a few maps feel wrong.
3. Ice / Fire / Hollow still need verbs and unique art, same two-path tower idea later.

Captured for later — not in this pass:

- Music — richer campaign loops (we have a quiet procedural prepare/battle pad; still no real score)
- Enemy attributes / speed variety — gait is visual only; projectile feel should stay readable when scouts and brutes differ more
- Splash / economy retune — after play + verbs, not before (cannon ~1.5 tiles, ice/fire mid, poison tiny, arrow single, lightning chain)
- Unique art for Ice / Fire / Hollow (Forest keepers + Desert four bodies are in)
- Ice / lightning / fire / poison forks (same two-path idea as Arrow/Cannon)
- Hand-painted Krita/GIMP tile variants
- Tiled as a visual map editor that exports into `levels.ts` (single source of truth must stay TypeScript)
- MagicaVoxel / Blender sprite sheets for extra props
- On-death tricks (magma pop, wisp chill) once the roster feels right
- Split menus/HUD out of `src/main.ts` (it is the next file split, not a combat rewrite)
- Enemy sprite polish — per-creature cleanup, or image-gen if we explicitly choose
- Other CC0 creature packs if we find a meaner free set (no paid packs)
- More targeting modes (closest, strongest)
- Endless mode after campaign
- Mobile layout polish beyond basic stacking
- Tower preview ghosts with DPS estimate
- Cloud save / multiple profiles

Done since MVP:

- Speed control (1x / 2x / 3x)
- Particle bursts on kills / impacts
- Easy / Normal / Hard (green / gold / red on the title). Hard keeps a full opening kit; kill gold is 80%. Start gold and kill bounties scale with world HP so a new world’s gate is not secretly a Forest-10 opening. Stage HP climb stays a placement/upgrade check.
- Procedural combat SFX + mute
- Prepare/battle pad, path landmarks, wave-start sting, enemy gaits
- Painted enemies + towers + shots in the live match; Forest entrance and exit portals
- Forest tree set + mixed grass/path tiles; cannon carriage stays, barrel turns
- On-map 2×3 build tray, compact upgrade/sell, HUD chips, match vignette
- Forest path/grass split, bigger towers + shots, y-sort, spinning portal halos, HUD hearts/gold/wave, trays that sit toward empty grass, 4-frame enemy walks
- Click-to-place: grass → tray → Build, then done. Upgrade: once to preview next stats, again to pay (no third confirm).
- 4-dir walk/fly sheets (e/w files match the path; magenta fringe keyed off)
- Painted Forest campaign thumbs; hashed (not checker) thumbs on later worlds
- Flying vs ground targeting (cannon cannot lock air; Arrow and Lightning can)
- Desert as a place: sand tiles, desert props, Desert portals, painted campaign thumbs
- Four Desert bodies (Scorpion, Dune Runner, Dune Tyrant, Sand Khan) with one verb each
- Arrow/Cannon Lv3 forks (Faster/Heavier, Rapid-fire/Mortar). Sell refunds the path.
